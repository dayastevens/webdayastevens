## About Me

I'm a freelance science writer passionate about connecting the world to science :) 
My work can be seen in The Philadelphia Citizen and Colorado Green News.
I am currently working at the University of Pennsylvania in clinical trials on neuromuscular disease research, and when I'm not working you can most likely find me camping, hiking, thrifting or with my dog :)
